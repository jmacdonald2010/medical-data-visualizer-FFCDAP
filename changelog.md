Ready for tests, test not run yet. Commit/Push prior to first attempt at tests. The code required to get a similar heatmap to the one in the project folder is shockingly like the example code on the seaborn website for heatmaps.

Figured out the pd.melt chart. Used freeCodeCamp forum user ArbyC's approach w/ not using groupby before creating the chart(I, like many others, have strong feelings about the charting for this assignment). Working on filtering out the data for the last chart.

Trying to figure out how to get what they want with the pd.melt part of the assignment. Pd.melt was not mentioned in the course, nor was anything actually visualized with seaborn, so needless to say, this exceptionally difficult and incredibly frustrating. Done for the night with this with no real progress to speak of; will try at another time to figure this out.

Trying to figure out the pd.melt and graph with seaborn part. Not entirely sure what I should be doing here or what is the desired outcome. Commit/Push before logging into work.

Added some code to normalize the values per project requirements. Not yet tested. Did this work on a different computer, so for commit/push everything is getting pushed thanks to dropbox.

Began project. Loaded csv into df, have written code to calculate overweight per project requirements. Not yet tested.
